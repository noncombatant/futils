# `records` — splits a stream into records

## Usage

```
records [-eJn] [-l limit] [pathname [...]]
```

## Description

Reads the given `pathname`s (or `stdin` if none are given), splits them into
records, and prints them.

## Options

* `-e`: Print empty records, too.
* `-l`: Limit the number of records printed. If `limit` is < 0, the limit is
  counted back from the last record in the input.
* `-J`: Output JSON format.
* `-n`: Prefix each record with a record number.

## Additional Options

* `-h`: Print this help page.
* `-R`: Set the output record delimiter. The default delimiter is `\n`.
* `-r`: Set the input record delimiter, a regular expression.

Regular expressions use [the Rust regex library
syntax](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/).

## Exit Status

| Exit Status    | Meaning            |
|----------------|--------------------|
|              0 | Success            |
|             -1 | Generic failure    |
| greater than 1 | Number of errors   |

## Examples

```
records some-file.txt
```

This is similar to POSIX `cat`, except that it will convert any line break
sequences into `\n`. This is due to the default values of `-d` and `-o`.

```
records -r '\r\n' -R '\n' some-file.txt
```

As above, but explicitly convert DOS/Windows/Internet new line sequences (only)
into POSIX.

```
records -R '\0' some-file.txt
```

Delimit records in some-file.txt with the `NUL` character (`\0`). This is
typically used together with other utilities that use `NUL` to delimit records
in a more robust way (such as when the other utilities may treat the file’s
existing delimiters as as syntactic metacharacters of some kind). For example,

```
records -R '\0' list-of-files.txt | xargs -0 foo...
```

With its `-l` option, `records` can work somewhat like `head` and `tail`.
Positive limits work like `head`, while negative limits work like `tail`. Try
these examples:

```
head -n5 your-file.txt
records -l5 your-file.txt
tail -n5 your-file.txt
records -l-5 your-file.txt
```
