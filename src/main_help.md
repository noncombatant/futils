# `futils` - functional shell utilities

## Usage

```
futils -h
futiles help
```

## Description

`futils` is a suite of shell utilities that somewhat resemble functional
programming primitives and operate on streams.

`futils` has various sub-commands:

* `apply`
* `fields`
* `files`
* `filter`
* `map`
* `records`
* `status`
* `version`

…and more to come.

To learn more about each one, run

```
futils sub-command -h
```

e.g.

```
futils apply -h
```

You can also invoke `futils` utilities directly, e.g.

```
apply -h
files -h
```

…and so on.
