# `apply` â€” apply commands to records of input

## Usage

```
apply [-v] -x command [pathname [...]]
```

## Description

For each record in each of the given `pathname`(s), runs the shell command
`command`. If no pathnames are given, reads `stdin`.

## Options

You can give more than 1 instance of `-x command`, to run multiple commands on
each input record.

## Additional Options
