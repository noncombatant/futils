# `map` â€” transform records of input

## Usage

```
map -x command [pathname [...]]
```

## Description

For each record in each of the given `pathname`(s), runs the shell command
`command` with each field of the record as a distinct argument. If no pathnames
are given, reads `stdin`.

## Options

* `-x`: Run `command` on each record of input.

You can give more than 1 instance of `-x command`, to run multiple commands on
each input record.

## Additional Options

* `-h`: Print this help page.
* `-f`: Set the input field delimiter, a regular expression.
* `-R`: Set the output record delimiter.
* `-r`: Set the input record delimiter.
* `-v`: Print the standard output of commands given with the `-x` option. (By
  default, `apply` only prints their standard error.)

Regular expressions use [the Rust regex library
syntax](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/).
