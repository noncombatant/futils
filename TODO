Add a `join` command, like join(1)

Add foldr and foldl and sum and so on, zip, reduce, fields, map

Add JSON input and output to all commands. Add a `json2fixed` (or similar)
command that turns JSON into a table view, so that people donâ€™t have to use `vd`
all the time. Or maybe that is `vd input.json -b -o output.md`. Not really.
Maybe it's `fields`...

Similarly, provide or find a good Markdown-to-terminal-escape program. Possibly

Tests for everything

When options can be given more than once, note that in the help strings for
every program.

In files.rs, consider the move from regex::Regex to regex::bytes::Regex. Maybe
options.match_expressions, et c., should be enums with both variants.

Create a `trash` program that puts things in a trashcan, for 2-phase delete?
Hard to do safely and correctly, and therefore fun?
