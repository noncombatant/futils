Add a `join` command, like join(1)

Add foldr and foldl and sum and so on, zip, reduce, fields, map

Add JSON input and output to all commands. Add a `json2fixed` (or similar)
command that turns JSON into a table view, so that people donâ€™t have to use `vd`
all the time.

Tests for everything

Add a `fields` command, somewhat like `cut`(1)

Convert index.html to README.md.

Use `foo` instead of *foo* for variables in help strings

Write down project goals:

* Structured data; JSON everywhere
* Modern: Unicode everywhere, complete Markdown documentation, complete tests
* Consistently flexible: REs everywhere applicable
* Consistent command line structure and behavior
* At least as time- and space- efficient as classic equivalents
* Safe: Memory-safe, typeful, mistake-resistant UX, as side-effect safe as
  possible
