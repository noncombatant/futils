Add a `join` command, like join(1)

Add foldr and foldl and sum and so on, zip, reduce, fields, map

Add JSON input and output to all commands. Add a `json2fixed` (or similar)
command that turns JSON into a table view, so that people don’t have to use `vd`
all the time. Or maybe that is `vd input.json -b -o output.md`. Not really.
Maybe it's `fields`...

Similarly, provide or find a good Markdown-to-terminal-escape program. Possibly

Tests for everything

Add a `fields` command, somewhat like `cut`(1). For JSON inputs, it can select
fields by name.

When options can be given more than once, note that. in the help strings for
every program.

Turn what `records` does in `records_main` into a reusable function and use it
everywhere `DEFAULT_INPUT_RECORD_DELIMITER` is used — i.e. RE-ify all input
handling.

Use headings in the help message for name, usage, description, options,
additional options
