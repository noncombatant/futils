Add a `join` command, like join(1)

Add foldr and foldl and sum and so on, zip, reduce, fields, map

Add JSON input and output to all commands. Add a `json2fixed` (or similar)
command that turns JSON into a table view, so that people donâ€™t have to use `vd`
all the time.

Tests for everything

Add a `fields` command, somewhat like `cut`(1)

Use `foo` instead of *foo* for variables in help strings
