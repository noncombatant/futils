Add a `join` command, like join(1)

Add foldr and foldl and sum and so on, zip, reduce, fields, map

Add JSON input and output to all commands. Add a `json2fixed` (or similar)
command that turns JSON into a table view, so that people donâ€™t have to use `vd`
all the time. Or maybe that is `vd input.json -b -o output.md`. Not really.
Maybe it's `fields`...

Similarly, provide or find a good Markdown-to-terminal-escape program. Possibly

Tests for everything

Add a `fields` command, somewhat like `cut`(1). For JSON inputs, it can select
fields by name.

When options can be given more than once, note that in the help strings for
every program.

RE-ify all input record handling by using `StreamSplitter` everywhere and
changing `DEFAULT_INPUT_RECORD_DELIMITER` to be an RE. This may obviate
sub_slicer.rs.
